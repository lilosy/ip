# UI Test Plan

This file defines the console UI checks run by `.codex/skills/test-ui/scripts/run-ui-tests.ps1`.
Each interaction runs its PowerShell input as a separate program session. Keep the expected output exact; the runner ignores only a single trailing line ending.

## Test Case: Exit politely

**Aim:** Verify that Lily starts, accepts `bye`, and displays its farewell message.

### Interaction 1

**Input**

```powershell
javac -d _temp\ui-test-out src\main\java\*.java; "bye" | java -cp _temp\ui-test-out Lily
```

**Expected output**

```text
 _     _ _       
| |   (_) |      
| |    _| |_   _ 
| |   | | | | | |
| |___| | | |_| |
\_____/_|\__, |  
          __/ |  
         |___/   

Hey there! I'm Lily.
What would you like to do today?
----------------------------------------------------------

Bye! See you soon :)
```

## Test Case: Save task changes

**Aim:** Verify that successful task changes are written to the data file in a parseable format.

### Interaction 1

**Input**

```powershell
Remove-Item -LiteralPath data\lily.txt -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue; javac -d _temp\ui-test-out src\main\java\*.java; "todo read book`ndeadline return book /by 2019-12-02`nmark 1`nbye" | java -cp _temp\ui-test-out Lily; Get-Content -LiteralPath data\lily.txt; Remove-Item -LiteralPath data\lily.txt
```

**Expected output**

```text
 _     _ _       
| |   (_) |      
| |    _| |_   _ 
| |   | | | | | |
| |___| | | |_| |
\_____/_|\__, |  
          __/ |  
         |___/

```
